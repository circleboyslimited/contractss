The system is intentionally modular: `stellar_send` is the only contract that end users interact with directly. `fee_collector` and `token_bridge` are infrastructure contracts managed by the protocol admin.

## Contracts

### stellar\_send

**Path:** `contracts/stellar_send/`

The main entry point for the StellarSend protocol. Supports direct token transfers and DEX path payments between any Stellar addresses.

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| Direct payments | Transfer any SEP-41 token from sender to recipient |
| Path payments | Route through the Stellar DEX for cross-asset transfers |
| Fee deduction | Protocol fee in basis points (bps), deducted at source |
| Pause / unpause | Admin can halt new payments in an emergency |
| Payment records | Every transfer is stored on-ledger for auditability |
| Admin rotation | Two-step admin handover (propose → accept) |

**Key data types:**

```rust
pub struct ContractConfig {
    pub admin: Address,
    pub fee_bps: u32,          // 100 bps = 1%
    pub fee_collector: Address,
    pub active: bool,
    pub min_amount: i128,
    pub max_amount: i128,
}

pub struct PaymentRecord {
    pub from: Address,
    pub to: Address,
    pub token: Address,
    pub net_amount: i128,
    pub fee_amount: i128,
    pub memo: String,
    pub ledger: u32,
}
```

---

### fee\_collector

**Path:** `contracts/fee_collector/`

Receives protocol fees forwarded by `stellar_send` and allows the treasury admin to withdraw accumulated balances.

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| Fee accounting | Tracks lifetime totals collected per token |
| Withdrawal | Admin-only; supports arbitrary recipient |
| Treasury management | Treasury address updatable by admin |
| Period limits | Configurable withdrawal limit per epoch |
| Multi-token | Operates on any SEP-41 token |

---

### token\_bridge

**Path:** `contracts/token_bridge/`

A lightweight wrap / unwrap bridge for non-native Stellar assets. Users deposit an underlying token and receive an equal amount of wrapped tokens, enabling cross-asset path payments through the StellarSend DEX flow.

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| wrap | Deposit underlying → receive wrapped balance |
| unwrap | Burn wrapped balance → receive underlying |
| Bridge fee | Configurable bps fee on wrap operations |
| Supply cap | Configurable maximum wrapped supply |
| Pause / unpause | Admin can halt wrapping in an emergency |
| Admin rotation | Two-step admin handover |

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

| Tool | Version | Install |
|---|---|---|
| Rust | stable (see `rust-toolchain.toml`) | `curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf \| sh` |
| Soroban CLI | ≥ 21.0.0 | `cargo install --locked soroban-cli` |
| wasm32 target | — | `rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown` |

### Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/StellarSend/contracts.git
cd contracts
```

The workspace `Cargo.toml` pins all dependency versions. No additional install step is required.

---

## Building

Build all contracts to WASM:

```bash
make build
# or directly:
bash scripts/build.sh
```

Individual contract:

```bash
soroban contract build --package stellar_send
soroban contract build --package fee_collector
soroban contract build --package token_bridge
```

Compiled WASM files are written to `target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/`.

---

## Testing

Run the full test suite:

```bash
make test
# or:
bash scripts/test.sh
```

Individual contract tests:

```bash
cargo test -p stellar_send
cargo test -p fee_collector
cargo test -p token_bridge
```

Run with output:

```bash
cargo test -p stellar_send -- --nocapture
```

---

## Deployment

### Testnet

```bash
# Set environment
export STELLAR_NETWORK=testnet
export STELLAR_RPC_URL=https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org
export STELLAR_ACCOUNT=<your-secret-key>

# Deploy fee_collector first (stellar_send depends on its address)
bash scripts/deploy.sh fee_collector

# Deploy token_bridge
bash scripts/deploy.sh token_bridge

# Deploy stellar_send, passing fee_collector address
bash scripts/deploy.sh stellar_send <fee_collector_address>
```

### Mainnet

Same steps as testnet; update `STELLAR_NETWORK=mainnet` and `STELLAR_RPC_URL=https://horizon.stellar.org`.

> **Note:** Mainnet deployments require a multi-sig admin key. Refer to the [Security](#security) section.

## Contract API Reference

### stellar\_send

#### `initialize(admin, fee_bps, fee_collector) → Result<(), StellarSendError>`

Initialise the contract. Must be called exactly once by `admin`.

- `fee_bps`: Protocol fee in basis points. Range: `0..=10_000`.
- `fee_collector`: Address of the deployed `fee_collector` contract.

#### `send_payment(from, to, token, amount, memo) → Result<PaymentRecord, StellarSendError>`

Transfer `amount` of `token` from `from` to `to`. The protocol fee is deducted from `amount` before transfer.

**Requires auth from:** `from`

#### `send_path_payment(from, to, send_token, send_amount, dest_token, min_dest_amount, path) → Result<i128, StellarSendError>`

Route a payment through the Stellar DEX. The fee is deducted from `send_amount` before the swap is attempted.

**Requires auth from:** `from`

#### `set_fee(new_fee_bps) → Result<(), StellarSendError>`

Update the protocol fee. **Admin only.**

#### `pause() / unpause() → Result<(), StellarSendError>`

Halt or resume new payments. **Admin only.**

#### `transfer_admin(new_admin) → Result<(), StellarSendError>`

Propose a new admin (step 1 of 2). **Current admin only.**

#### `accept_admin() → Result<(), StellarSendError>`

Complete the admin rotation (step 2 of 2). **Proposed admin only.**

#### `get_config() → Result<ContractConfig, StellarSendError>`

Return current configuration.

#### `get_payment_record(from, seq) → Result<PaymentRecord, StellarSendError>`

Retrieve a stored payment record by sender address and sequence number.

---

### fee\_collector

#### `initialize(admin, treasury) → Result<(), FeeCollectorError>`

#### `collect_fee(token, amount) → Result<(), FeeCollectorError>`

Record fee receipt. The token transfer must already have been made by `stellar_send`.

#### `withdraw(token, amount, recipient) → Result<(), FeeCollectorError>`

Withdraw fees to `recipient`. **Admin only.**

#### `get_balance(token) → i128`

Return current token balance held by the contract.

#### `get_total_collected(token) → i128`

Return the lifetime total of fees collected in `token`.

---

### token\_bridge

#### `initialize(admin, underlying_token) → Result<(), TokenBridgeError>`

#### `wrap(from, amount) → Result<i128, TokenBridgeError>`

Deposit `amount` of underlying token; credit wrapped balance.

#### `unwrap(from, amount) → Result<i128, TokenBridgeError>`

Burn `amount` of wrapped balance; return underlying tokens.

#### `get_wrapped_balance(holder) → i128`

#### `get_underlying_token() → Result<Address, TokenBridgeError>`

---

## Events

All contracts emit structured events consumable by the Horizon API or Soroban event subscriptions.

| Contract | Topic | Data |
|---|---|---|
| stellar_send | `payment_sent` | `(from, to, token, net_amount, fee_amount, memo)` |
| stellar_send | `path_payment_sent` | `(from, to, send_token, send_amount, dest_token, dest_amount, fee_amount)` |
| stellar_send | `fee_updated` | `(old_bps, new_bps)` |
| stellar_send | `paused / unpaused` | `ledger` |
| fee_collector | `fee_received` | `(token, amount)` |
| fee_collector | `fee_withdrawn` | `(token, recipient, amount)` |
| token_bridge | `wrapped` | `(underlying, amount)` |
| token_bridge | `unwrapped` | `(underlying, amount)` |

Subscribe to events via Horizon:

```bash
soroban events --contract-id <CONTRACT_ID> --network testnet
```

## Security

### Admin key management

- All admin keys should be multi-sig accounts on mainnet.
- Admin rotation uses a two-step propose/accept pattern to prevent key loss.
- The `fee_collector` treasury address is separate from the admin key.

### Audit status

| Contract | Auditor | Status |
|---|---|---|
| stellar\_send | — | In progress |
| fee\_collector | — | In progress |
| token\_bridge | — | In progress |

### Reporting vulnerabilities

Please report security issues privately via email to **security@stellarsend.io**. Do **not** open a public issue for a security vulnerability. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for our responsible disclosure policy.
